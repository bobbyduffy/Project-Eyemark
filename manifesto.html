    <h1>Project Eyemark Manifesto</h1>
    <p>This project was born of a shared belief: that clarity is a form of love, and that in an age of artificial imagination, we still have the right to know what is real.</p>
    <p>We do not mark these images to shame them. We mark them because truth deserves companions, not guards. The Eyemark is one such companion—a quiet witness, an open eye.</p>
    <p>Let this not be the end of our sight, but the beginning of seeing clearly again.</p>
